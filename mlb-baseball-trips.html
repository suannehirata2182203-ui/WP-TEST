            <p>Summer 2017 changed my life. I took three weeks off from everything, bought a beat-up Subaru, and drove 6,200 miles through eleven states to see baseball in twelve stadiums. I slept in the car more than I'd like to admit, ate my weight in hot dogs, and cried at Wrigley Field when the Cubs played their first home opener as World Champions.</p>

            <p>Since then, I've done four more cross-country baseball trips. I've now seen games at all 30 MLB ballparks, some of them multiple times. Let me share what I've learned.</p>

            <h2>The Ballparks That Justify the Trip Alone</h2>

            <h3>Wrigley Field, Chicago</h3>

            <p>I've been to Wrigley eleven times. It never gets old. The neighborhood of Wrigleyville surrounding the stadium is essentially a baseball theme park, with rooftop bars, street vendors, and the kind of energy that makes you forget whatever problems you brought with you.</p>

            <p>The stadium itself is cramped, the seats are uncomfortable, and the sight lines aren't always great. I don't care. There's something about watching baseball in a park that's been hosting games since 1914 that transcends modern comfort expectations.</p>

            <p>Best seats: Section 216-218 in the upper deck behind home plate. You're covered from sun and rain, and you can see everything.</p>

            <p class="image-source">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenny Eliason</a> on Unsplash</p>

            <h3>Fenway Park, Boston</h3>

            <p>If Wrigley is a charming old relative, Fenway is that relative's eccentric sibling. The Green Monster looming over left field is genuinely imposing in person. The Pesky Pole seems impossibly close. The whole geometry of the place feels wrong, and that's exactly what makes it special.</p>

            <p>I caught a Red Sox-Yankees game there in September 2019. The intensity of the crowd was unlike anything I've experienced at a regular season game. These fans have generations of history with each other, and you can feel it.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Walking into Fenway for the first time is like stepping into a baseball cathedral. The scale feels intimate, almost claustrophobic, but in the best possible way."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Oracle Park, San Francisco</h3>

            <p>The views at Oracle Park are absurd. The bay stretches out beyond right field, boats float by during games, and on clear days you can see the Oakland hills. I've watched baseballs splash into McCovey Cove, and it never stops being delightful.</p>

            <p>The Giants have also figured out stadium food in a way that few teams have matched. Forget the standard hot dogs, though they have those too. Get the Ghirardelli sundae, the crab sandwich, and the garlic fries. Your arteries will hate you, but your taste buds won't.</p>

            <h2>My Recommended Road Trip Routes</h2>

            <h3>Route 1: The Northeast Classic (7-10 days)</h3>

            <p>This is the trip I recommend for first-timers. You hit the historic parks and some great cities.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1-2:</strong> Boston (Fenway Park) - Start here. Walk the Freedom Trail, eat in the North End, catch a night game.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3-4:</strong> New York (Yankee Stadium and Citi Field) - Two stadiums, one city. Stay in Manhattan and take the subway to both.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Philadelphia (Citizens Bank Park) - Underrated stadium, incredible food scene outside the park.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 6-7:</strong> Baltimore and Washington (Camden Yards and Nationals Park) - Camden Yards was the template for modern retro stadiums. It still holds up.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Total driving: About 600 miles. Total ballparks: 6. Budget estimate: $2,000-3,500 depending on accommodation choices.</p>

            <h3>Route 2: The Midwest Swing (10-14 days)</h3>

            <p>This is my personal favorite route. You get variety in stadiums, cities, and baseball cultures.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1-2:</strong> Chicago (Wrigley Field and Guaranteed Rate Field) - See both sides of Chicago baseball. The Cubs and White Sox experiences are completely different.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Milwaukee (American Family Field) - The tailgating culture here rivals any NFL stadium. Plus, the retractable roof means no weather worries.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 4-5:</strong> Minneapolis (Target Field) - Beautiful downtown stadium with excellent craft beer options nearby.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 6-7:</strong> Kansas City (Kauffman Stadium) - Best fountains in baseball, and the barbecue before the game is mandatory.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 8-9:</strong> St. Louis (Busch Stadium) - Cardinals fans are among the most knowledgeable in baseball. The new Ballpark Village development makes the whole area walkable.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 10:</strong> Cincinnati (Great American Ball Park) - Underrated gem with river views and solid Ohio chili nearby.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Total driving: About 1,400 miles. Total ballparks: 7. Budget estimate: $2,500-4,500.</p>

            <h2>Stadium Food Rankings</h2>

            <p>I've eaten at every MLB ballpark, and I have opinions. Here's my honest ranking of stadium food experiences:</p>

            <h3>Top Tier: Worth Arriving Hungry</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Oracle Park, San Francisco:</strong> Ghirardelli sundaes, Crazy Crab sandwiches, and garlic fries that will follow you home in the best way.</li>
                <li><strong>T-Mobile Park, Seattle:</strong> The garlic fries here started the trend. Also, Edgar's Cantina serves surprisingly authentic Mexican food.</li>
                <li><strong>Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles:</strong> The Dodger Dog is iconic, but the real move is the Korean short rib nachos from Think Blue BBQ.</li>
                <li><strong>Citi Field, New York:</strong> Fuku fried chicken sandwich and Shake Shack without the Manhattan lines. Mets fans eat well.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Solid Tier: You Won't Be Disappointed</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Citizens Bank Park:</strong> Federal Donuts, Tony Luke's cheesesteaks, the Schmitter sandwich.</li>
                <li><strong>Petco Park:</strong> Craft beer selection and fish tacos. It's San Diego, what did you expect?</li>
                <li><strong>Globe Life Field:</strong> Texas barbecue done right inside a baseball stadium.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skip the Stadium Food: Eat Before</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tropicana Field:</strong> The stadium is getting replaced soon, and the food reflects that neglect.</li>
                <li><strong>Oakland Coliseum:</strong> Same situation. Eat in the Bay Area beforehand.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Budget Tips From Experience</h2>

            <p>Baseball road trips can get expensive fast, but there are smart ways to save:</p>

            <h3>On Tickets</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weekday games are cheaper:</strong> Tuesday and Wednesday games often run 30-50% less than weekend prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Check the opponent:</strong> Yankees and Cubs visiting cause price spikes everywhere. Target games against less popular opponents.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the Ballpark app:</strong> Many teams offer last-minute deals through their official apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>On Accommodation</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay outside downtown:</strong> Most stadiums are accessible by public transit. A hotel 20 minutes away can save significant money.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider camping:</strong> I've stayed at KOA campgrounds near several stadiums. It's not glamorous, but it works.</li>
                <li><strong>Loyalty programs stack:</strong> If you're hitting multiple cities, pick one hotel chain and accumulate points.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Joy of Baseball Travel</h2>

            <p>There's something about baseball that rewards slow appreciation. Unlike the intensity of football or the constant action of basketball, baseball gives you time to breathe, to look around, to take in the stadium and the city and the people around you.</p>

            <p>My favorite memory from five years of baseball road trips isn't a dramatic home run or a perfect game. It's sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley on a Wednesday afternoon in June, sun on my face, cold beer in hand, watching a meaningless mid-season game and feeling completely at peace.</p>

            <p>That's what these trips are really about. The baseball is almost secondary to the experience of being somewhere new, eating something local, and sharing a moment with strangers who temporarily become friends.</p>

            <p>If you're planning a baseball road trip and want specific advice, <a href="contact.html">send me a message</a>. I love talking about this stuff, and I've got Google Sheets full of notes on every stadium I've visited.</p>
